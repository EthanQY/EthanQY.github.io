In this blog post, I will share my understanding of the basic principles of the Kalman Filter, its implementation in Matlab, and the proof of its optimality. The Kalman Filter is a powerful tool for state estimation in linear systems with Gaussian noise, and it has wide applications in various fields such as control systems, signal processing, and robotics. Details see in my Zhihu column: [Kalman Filter: Basic Principles, Matlab Implementation, and proof](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/721667468).
