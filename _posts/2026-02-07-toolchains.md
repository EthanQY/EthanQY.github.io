In this blog post, I will share my experiences with various coding environments and toolchains that I have used throughout my academic and research journey, especially in the context of **vehicle dynamics** and **control research**. I will cover my experiences with operating systems (**Ubuntu, Windows and macOS**), programming languages (Python and MATLAB), and specific tools like CarSim. I hope this can provide some insights for students and researchers who are new to these tools or are looking for recommendations on which tools to use for their research.

Note that the detailed versions of this blog can be found in my Zhihu column: [Coding Environments & Toolchains](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1813359218176163841). This column is evolving continuously by Feb 2026.
