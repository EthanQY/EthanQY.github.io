In this blog post, I will provide a brief introduction to LaTeX, a powerful typesetting system widely used for academic writing, especially in fields like mathematics, computer science, engineering, and physics. LaTeX allows you to create professional-looking documents with complex formatting, mathematical equations, and references with ease.

Note that this tutorial is intended for researchers and students in STEM fields to write research papers, theses and slides, not for professional typesetting.
